### About Me  

I am a **third-year BCA student** with an unshakable passion for **web development** and a curiosity that drives me to explore cutting-edge stacks such as **MERN** and **VENM**. My journey in tech is not just about writing code — it’s about **building experiences** that are intuitive, impactful, and scalable.  
As the **CEO of Inovus Labs IEDC**, I lead a vibrant, student-driven innovation and entrepreneurship community. In this role, I work at the intersection of **technology, leadership, and collaboration**, guiding teams to bring ideas to life and empowering peers to explore their creative potential.  
In parallel, I serve as the **Campus Lead of the µLearn Campus Chapter**, where I drive a culture of peer-to-peer learning, skill-building, and growth. My work here revolves around connecting students with opportunities, fostering meaningful collaborations, and building a strong foundation for professional and personal development.  
Currently, I’m interning as a **Front-End Web Developer at µLearn**, where I sharpen my technical skills, work with modern frameworks, and contribute to real-world projects. This hands-on experience fuels my commitment to mastering the **full-stack ecosystem**, with the vision of evolving into a **versatile developer and problem-solver**.  
For me, technology is more than just a career choice — it’s a **canvas** where logic meets creativity, and innovation becomes reality. I aim to keep pushing boundaries, learning relentlessly, and building solutions that truly matter.
